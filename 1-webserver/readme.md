# Simple Express Webserver

A simple express webserver with some pages to learn the basics of express and what you can do with routes.

Main things I learned:
- how to use the path and body-parser modules
- what routes are
- how to respond to http get and post requests
- how to serve static content like webpages and images
- how to serve json content
- how to retrieve variables from GET req urls, and POST req bodies
- how to redirect pages to other pages

# Installation

npm install
